\chapter*{Abstract}

Temporal large-eddy simulation (TLES) is a promising method to reduce computational costs compared to DNS for turbulent flows, and offers several potential advantages over conventional spatial LES. A TLES method based termed the temporal exact deconvolution model (TEDM) has previously been developed in OpenFAOM but found to be unstable for large filter widths. In this project, a regularization term was designed, implemented, and tested to investigate its potential for stabilization of the method. Concurrently, a divergence cleaning method using the projection scheme was also added to the solver to test if non-zero divergence might be a source of the instabilities. Demonstration of the base method and the new stabilization strategies was realized using the Pitz-Daily backwards-facing step geometry provided in OpenFOAM, and a variety of different parameter combinations and model configurations were analyzed for both stability and for deviation from a stable baseline simulation.
